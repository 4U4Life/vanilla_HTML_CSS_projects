# What about ?
This is a [Brad Travesry](https://github.com/bradtraversy) course from
[udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/).

Brad explain the daily trivial techniques in HTML, CSS and especially dealing with
DOM without using any framework especially `JQuery`

# Why so important not using framework ?

JavaScript framework in years come and sink down, either JavaScript in DOM will
always remain the same; and by the time the DOM features will enhanced as the
needs.

As Web developer I choose to follow the standard of Web development, not to
follow of ridiculous framework development. The development techniques is so
various but the standard will be the same in scaling Web development.
